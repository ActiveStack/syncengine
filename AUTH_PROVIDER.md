# Auth Provider

## Basic Auth Provider
Out of the box, ActiveStack provides a basic Auth Provider which uses simple username/password stored in the ActiveStack Auth database.

By default, the Basic Auth Provider is disabled.  In order to enable it, you must add the following line to your [env.properties](src/main/resources/env.properties.sample) file.
```
auth.basic.enabled=true
```

## Custom Auth Provider
ActiveStack allows you to define your own Auth Provider.  Follow these steps to create your own Custom Auth Provider.

- Create a new Custom Auth Provider Factory class.  This class is setup to be autowired by spring.  On PostConstruct, this Factory creates a new instance of a CustomAuthProvider and registers it with the ActiveStack AuthProviderRegistry.
```
@Component
public class CustomAuthProviderFactory {

    private static Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(CustomAuthProviderFactory.class);

	/**
	 * This is the ActiveStack Auth Provider registry. Auth Providers are
	 * identifed by their ID. This ID is passed from the client when attempting
	 * to authorize/register.  It is advised to namespace Auth Provider ID's.
	 */
    @Autowired
    AuthProviderRegistry authProviderRegistry;

    @PostConstruct
    public void init(){
		// Depending on the details of the Auth Provider, you need to inject the appropriate resources.
        CustomAuthProvider provider = new CustomAuthProvider();
        authProviderRegistry.addProvider(provider);
        logger.info("CustomAuth:.............ENABLED");
    }

}
```

- Create a new Custom Auth Provider class. This class does the actual work of authorizing and registering users.  It must implement the [IAuthProvider](src/main/java/com/percero/agents/auth/services/IAuthProvider.java) class, which defines these three functions:
  - `getID()`: Must return the UNIQUE ID of this Auth Provider.  It is recommended to name space any custom Auth Providers just to make sure there is no name collision.
  - `authorize(String credentialString)`: This is the function that is called to authorize a user.
    - The format of `credentialString` is completely customizable -- as long as the client app and server Auth Provider agree on the format.  There is a `BasicAuthCredential` defined as part of ActiveStack that can de-serialize the String `username:password` or `{"username":"<my_user_name","password":"<my_password>"}`.
   - `register(String credentialString)`: This is the function that is called to register a user.  Note that an Auth Provider does NOT need to support this functionality.  If an Auth Provider does NOT support this functionality, the response should simply be an `AuthProviderResponse` with a failed result.
     - The format of `credentialString` is completely customizable -- as long as the client app and server Auth Provider agree on the format.  There is a `BasicAuthCredential` defined as part of ActiveStack that can de-serialize the String `username:password` or `{"username":"<my_user_name","password":"<my_password>"}`.
